# Home-automation-system
Home automation involves a network of interconnected smart devices communicating via Bluetooth and the internet. Each device uses mechanisms and sensors to automate mundane tasks around your house, allowing you to control them via your smartphone. 
Some home automation tasks can be achieved right now for relatively little cost, but some are expensive – whilst others are still a pipe dream. But even automation a few repetitive tasks around your house is worth doing, so read on to learn all that you need to know. 
Home automation is a wireless home appliance control system accessed by a remote device such as mobile phone (Android or ios)to allow a home owner to control , monitor and coordinate home appliances , without changing the home infrastructure.

WHY BLUETOOTH ?
 A Bluetooth based wireless home automation system can be implement with a low cost and it is easy to install in an existing home. A research work proved that Bluetooth system are faster than wireless and GSM systems. Bluetooth technology has ability to transmit data serially up to 3 Mbps within a physical range of 10m to 100m depending on the type of Blue tooth device…
METHODS TO DEVELOP A MODEL :
The design of proposed method is based on Arduino board, Bluetooth module, sensors and smartphone application. Bluetooth module HC-05 is interfaced with Arduino board and home appliances are connected with Arduino board via relay. Smartphone application is used for serial communication between smartphone and Bluetooth module which is further connected with Arduino board. 

Home automation involves mixing different electrical components to automate actions or devices around your house, including:
Sensors: This is a component which monitors different parts of the environment (such as temperature, light levels and video/cameras). They collect valuable data which allows the home automation device to know how they need to act.
Controllers: A centralized device which receives data and other inputs, and ‘works out’ what needs to be do – i.e. perform an action. This is a bit like the motherboard (and associated hardware) within a computer that receives inputs – from the keyboard and mouse- and performs ‘outputs’/actions – such as performing a calculation and showing something on the screen.
Actuators: This is a fancy word for something which allows access, movement or control of a device, such as a light switch, motor and valve![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96488109/204084488-c9635ff9-3f88-4df0-a152-a5754c652d7d.png)

A home automated device can then be made smart by hooking it up to devices like smartphones via Bluetooth or most commonly the internet…
Internet connected: an automated device can contain computer components which allow it to make internet calls to a central location, via TCP/IP and probably HTTP (similar to what happens when you access a website with your web browser).
This will involve the device transmitting data about itself to ‘the cloud’, but also allows it to accept actions to perform – such as ‘turn up the heating’, ‘close the garage door’ or ‘turn on power’ in a smart plug.
User interface: now that the device is ‘available’ on the internet, it needs some way of displaying its data – and allowing it to be controlled.
This is usually done via a smartphone app (for example to control smart thermostats or smart lightbulbs), although some smart devices also have a website-based control system (such as indoor and outdoor security cameras).
